## Description

The idea of a personal dashboard was born when I realize the need of an application for myself where I can keep track of my expenses and remind me of things I need to complete. This application is devided in three section. The top section, where it includes a random Quote to inspire me as soon as I open up the page. The left section is my expenses section where I can keep track of my income and expeneses. The right section is my reminder section where it reminds me of the things, chores, and projects I need to complete. Data is being stored in firebase's firestore and return in real time.
